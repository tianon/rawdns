Save as `/etc/rawdns/config.json`:

```json
{
	"docker.": {
		"type": "containers",
		"socket": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
	},
	"local.": {
		"type": "forwarding",
		"nameservers": [ "192.168.1.1" ]
	},
	".": {
		"type": "forwarding",
		"nameservers": [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ]
	}
}
```

Then:

```console
$ docker run --rm -p 53:53/udp -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /etc/rawdns/config.json:/etc/rawdns/config.json:ro tianon/rawdns rawdns /etc/rawdns/config.json
2014/09/23 14:46:10 listening on domain: docker.
2014/09/23 14:46:10 listening on domain: local.
2014/09/23 14:46:10 listening on domain: .
```

The most-specific domain gets the request (ie, if you have both `docker.` and `containers.docker.` and you do a lookup for `something.containers.docker`, you'll get back the IP of the container named `something`).

The default configuration only includes `docker.` going to `/var/run/docker.sock` and `.` going to `8.8.8.8`+`8.8.4.4`.

## wat

Since DNS is a protocol (which is a type of API), and Docker has an API, it makes a lot more sense to have DNS be a raw interface to Docker than it does to treat DNS like a database and try to synchronize the two data sources.

## why

I've eventually grown to dislike every "Docker DNS" project for one reason or another, and usually the misgivings boil down to treating DNS like a database, which reminds me of my favorite thing to say about databases: if you have the same data in two places, they are guaranteed to eventually get out of sync in some way (no matter how clever you or your code are).

## how

This is implemented by borrowing the core of SkyDNS, [`github.com/miekg/dns`](https://github.com/miekg/dns).  It's a really great, but very raw, DNS library for Go that makes it really easy to write a DNS server or client.  One of the explicit design goals of the project is "If there is stuff you should know as a DNS programmer there isn't a convenience function for it."

## swarm mode (Docker 1.12) support

`rawdns` can be used with swarm mode by creating a configuration with the `swarmmode` set to true.  The `swarmnode` option enables `rawdns` to query by service name instead of container name it will return the assigned virtual ip for the service. You can at the same time filter vip, which belong to a given network (use the `networkId` for this).

Example swarm configuration:

```json
{
    "swarm.": {
        "type": "containers",
        "socket": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock",
        "swarmmode": true,
        "networkId": "2zcqib9vlz6fa0gotr525dgcm",
        "tlsverify": true,
        "tlscacert": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-root-ca.crt",
        "tlscert": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.crt",
        "tlskey": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.key"
    },
    "example.tld.": {
        "type": "containers",
        "socket": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock",
        "swarmmode": true,
        "networkId": "2zcqib9vlz6fa0gotr525dgcm",
        "tlsverify": true,
        "tlscacert": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-root-ca.crt",
        "tlscert": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.crt",
        "tlskey": "/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates/swarm-node.key"
    },
    ".": {
        "type": "forwarding",
        "nameservers": [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ]
    }
}
```

Example usage:

```shell
$ docker service create --name dns \
    --publish 53:53/udp \
    --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
    --mount type=bind,source=/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates,target=/var/lib/docker/swarm/certificates \
    --mount type=bind,source=/etc/rawdns/config.json,target=/etc/rawdns/config.json \
    tianon/rawdns rawdns /etc/rawdns/config.json

2015/09/14 21:50:49 rawdns v1.2 (go1.4.2 on linux/amd64; gc)
2015/09/14 21:50:49 listening on domain: .
2015/09/14 21:50:49 listening on domain: swarm.
2015/09/14 21:50:49 listening on domain: example.tld.
```

> NOTE: You need to create the config.json on every swarm member or use `--constraint` to only run on machines with the configuration. Other option is to use [Docker config storage](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/configs/), but it requires v17.06+.

You can now retrieve the vip of the `dns` service (`docker service inspect dns`) and use it like this:

`docker service create --name service-using-dns --dns <vip> --dns-search example.tld myaccount/myservice`

### Swarm mode: tasks lookup

Both service VIP and task ID addresses are supported. Lets look how it works. For diversity we'll use a compose file to get instances up and running.

#### Swarm mode: compose file

Example of compose file:

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  dns:
    image: tianon/rawdns
    #command: rawdns /etc/rawdns/config.json
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    #configs:
    #  - source: rawdns-config
    #    target: /etc/rawdns/config.json
    networks:
      - pub

  whoami:
    image: emilevauge/whoami
    hostname: '{{index .Service.Labels "com.docker.stack.namespace"}}-whoami-{{.Task.Slot}}.{{index .Service.Labels "com.docker.stack.namespace"}}-pub.swarm'
    ports:
     - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - pub
    deploy:
      replicas: 2

networks:
  pub:

#configs:
#  rawdns-config:
#    file: ./example-config.json
```

Deployment command:

```shell
$ docker stack deploy -c example-stack.yml rawdns

Creating network rawdns_pub
Creating service rawdns_whoami
Creating service rawdns_dns

$ docker service logs rawdns_dns
rawdns_dns.1.yffqfu016mrq@stikhonenko    | 2017/08/02 16:36:30 rawdns v1.6 (go1.7.6 on linux/amd64; gc)
rawdns_dns.1.yffqfu016mrq@stikhonenko    | 2017/08/02 16:36:30 listening on domain: .
rawdns_dns.1.yffqfu016mrq@stikhonenko    | 2017/08/02 16:36:30 listening on domain: docker.
rawdns_dns.1.yffqfu016mrq@stikhonenko    | 2017/08/02 16:36:30 listening on domain: swarm.
```
> NOTE: Here is used default `example-config.json` that is packed into `rawdns` image. If you need customize it uncomment and change appropriate lines in the compose file. Also note, that the example compose file uses [`configs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/configs/) functionality, that is available only since v17.06.

Lookup service VIP:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns_whoami.ingress.swarm.    0 IN    A       192.168.50.115
rawdns_whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN    A       10.0.2.2
```

Lookup task IP:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami-1.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.ingress.swarm. 0 IN A 192.168.50.115
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
```

### Swarm mode: filtering

`rawdns` expects the following pattern to look up service/task: `service[-taskSlot][.taskId][.network]`. Filtering is performed for any optional segments: taskSlot, taskId, network.

During stack deployment a service name is constructed as: `stack-name_service-name`. According [RFC 952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952) underscore isn't allowed in DNS names. So you can use dash ("-") instead of it to lookup. Both "_" and "-" are supported.

Lookup for service-name returns service VIPs for all available networks:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns_whoami.ingress.swarm.    0 IN    A       10.255.0.7
rawdns_whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN    A       10.0.2.2
```

Lookup for service-name with networkname returns service VIP only for the "networkname" network:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns_whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN    A       10.0.2.2
```

Lookup for service-name with taskSlot returns service instance IPs for the 1st slot and all available networks:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami-1.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.ingress.swarm.    0 IN A 192.168.50.115
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
```

Lookup for service-name with taskSlot and networkname returns service instance IP for the 1st slot and the "networkname" network:

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami-1.rawdns-pub.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
```

Dot separation (`service.taskSlot`) is also supported to mimic Docker DNS behavior. By default Docker DNS resolution uses the following names pattern: `stack_service.taskSlot.taskId[.network]`.

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns_whoami.1.rawdns_pub.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
```

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns_whoami.1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns_pub.swarm

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
```

### Swarm mode: DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) support

The [DNS Service Discovery](http://www.dns-sd.org/) specification has been developed to configure named instances of a service type and support multiple host and port combination for any service. In addition, it supports of the configuration of meta data for a specific service instance.

DNS-SD combines SRV, PTR, and TXT resource records for service lookup in the following way:

* PTR - used to map service types to named service instances.
* SRV - used to provide location and port for service instances.
* TXT - used to provide additional meta data about service instances.

`rawdns` has limited support of DNS-SD. It can inspect service tasks to construct SRV records. DNS query types SRV or ANY switch on the service discovery. `rawdns` also supports the "tasks" prefix to mimics Docker DNS behaviour: `tasks.servicename[.domain]`

```console
$ dig +nostats +nocmd +noquestion @localhost rawdns-whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm SRV

;; ANSWER SECTION:
rawdns-whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm.   0 IN  SRV     0 0 80 rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm.
rawdns-whoami.rawdns-pub.swarm.   0 IN  SRV     0 0 80 rawdns-whoami-2.eefjiqynai78hk57lbkozvaz4.rawdns-pub.swarm.
rawdns-whoami-1.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN  CNAME   rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm.
rawdns-whoami-2.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN  CNAME   rawdns-whoami-2.eefjiqynai78hk57lbkozvaz4.rawdns-pub.swarm.

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
rawdns-whoami-1.nw5d54fw6e1k95nv57oqwakrr.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.3
rawdns-whoami-2.eefjiqynai78hk57lbkozvaz4.rawdns-pub.swarm. 0 IN A 10.0.2.4
```

## swarm (legacy) support

`rawdns` can be used with swarm by creating a configuration that provides the socket details using the `tcp://` scheme.  You will also need to enable `swarmnode` by setting it to true.  The `swarmnode` option enables `rawdns` to look at the `Node` section of the inspect API response for the external/host IP address.

Example swarm configuration:

```json
{
    "swarm.": {
        "type": "containers",
        "socket": "tcp://192.168.99.100:3376",
        "swarmnode": true,
        "tlsverify": true,
        "tlscacert": "/var/lib/boot2docker/ca.pem",
        "tlscert": "/var/lib/boot2docker/server.pem",
        "tlskey": "/var/lib/boot2docker/server-key.pem"
    },
    "docker.": {
        "type": "containers",
        "socket": "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    },
    "local.": {
        "type": "forwarding",
        "nameservers": [ "172.17.42.1" ]
    },
    ".": {
        "type": "forwarding",
        "nameservers": [ "8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4" ]
    }
}
```

Example usage:

```shell
$ docker run --name dns --rm -it \
    -p 53:53/udp \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /var/lib/boot2docker:/var/lib/boot2docker \
    -v /etc/rawdns/config.json:/etc/rawdns/config.json:ro \
